# image-mask-estimate

We are trying to estimate how much people are adhering to a policy like mask wearing.
Our approach is to take some set of images. In each image, we count the number of
people wearing masks  and the number of people in the open (i.e., not in a vehicle). 
We take the average ratio of mask wearing for the set of images.


A solution is attempted by Akshay Gupta [here](https://github.com/akshay-gupta123/Face-Mask-Detection).
